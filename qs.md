how to implement Uber pool. given two trips find and algorithm to see if they should be pooled

Write a function that returns values randomly, according to their weight.

Implement data structure "Map" storing pairs of integers (key, value) and define following member functions in O(1) runtime: void insert(key, value), void delete(key), int get(key), int getRandomKey().

Given a string A and B, find the smallest substring of A that contains all the characters from B. (implement solution in O(n), keep in mind chars in B can repeat)

Given a picture of square with a bunch of horizontal and vertical lines in it (lines are not necessarily spanning the full square length, in other words think of a fine grid with many holes in it), design data structure(s) representing the data and a function that returns a number of squares pictured. (actual implementation expected)

How would you design Youtube (need for low latency, robustness against data loss, ...) (no implementation necessary)

Sketch design of a project you participated in. (on whiteboard)

input a list of array [[1, 2, 3], [1], [1, 2]] return the list of array, each array is a combination of one element in each array.
[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 1], [2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 1], [3, 1, 2]]

Followup: each array in the input list is an iterator, which can only be looped once.

1. Binary tree serialization/deserialization

2. Uber Pool System design (walk from signup process to how to get the nearest drivers)

3. Find overlapping meeting times

4. Implement autocomplete system

find the k smallest values in a binary search tree.

Write an algorithm to determine how similar/different two strings are. I was able to interpret this question any way I wanted. (percentage difference, character difference)
Answer Question
Working together to design an elevator with the interviewer.
Answer Question
Write an algorithm to determine if all of the delimiters in an expression are matched and closed.{(abc)22}[14(xyz)2] should pass
[ { ] } should fail
{ (x) } [ should fail

Given a message "one two three four five six seven eight nine", chop it in chunks(no exceed the give buffer size) and print out to the screen. Need to maintain the word and do not chop it off.
I.E.: buffer size is 15
one two three (1/4)
four five six (2/4)
seven eight (3/4)
nine (4/4)

Data structure question of getting a random entry from a collection in constant time

please construct a hash map

Focus on algorithms like sorting, searching, indexing and their applications in the problems. A revision of your graph theory course may help.

Why Uber. Design the backend architecture to show nearby drivers.

What's your biggest failure?

Write a code to construct a tree. It should get a string and generate related tree.

Given a set of sudoku boards, determine whether a board is valid or not.

The one about API rate throttler, mentioned in one of the glassdoor posts.

How would you improve Uber?

A file contains strings like abcd 3.0 xyx 4.0 foobar 5.0 return random string but probability should be based on weighted average

Implement a timer using queue.

find the kth smallest element of a BST. What are the purposes of a heap.

/*
Some examples:
isMatch(“aa”,”a”) ? false
isMatch(“aa”,”aa”) ? true
isMatch(“aaa”,”aa”) ? false
isMatch(“aa”, “a*”) ? true
isMatch(“aa”, “.*”) ? true
isMatch(“ab”, “.*”) ? true
isMatch(“aab”, “c*a*b”) ? true

Write isMatch()
